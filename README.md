This project provides a simple way to forward alerts generated by Grafana to a Matrix chat room.

Define a Grafana webhook alert channel that targets an instance of this application.
This tool will convert the incoming webhook to a Matrix message and send it on to a specific chat room.

## Features

  * üì¶ **Portable**
    * As a single binary the tool is easy to run in any environment
  * üìé **Simple**
    * No config files, all required parameters provided on startup
  * ü™Å **Flexible**
    * Support multiple grafana alert channels to multiple matrix rooms
  * üìà **Monitorable**
    * Export metrics to track successful and failed forwards

## How to use

**Step 1**

Run the forwarder by providing a matrix account to send messages from.

```
$ ./grafana-matrix-forwarder --user @userId:matrix.org --password xxx --homeserver matrix.org
```

**Step 2**

Add a new **POST webhook** alert channel with the following target URL: `http://<ip address>:6000/api/v0/forward?roomId=<roomId>`

*Replace with the server ID and matrix room ID.*

## CLI Usage

```
$ grafana-matrix-forwarder -h

  -homeserver string
        url of the homeserver to connect to (default "matrix.org")
  -host string
        host address the server connects to (default "0.0.0.0")
  -logPayload
        print the contents of every alert request received from grafana
  -password string

        username used to login to matrix
  -version

``` 

## Metrics

Access exported metrics at `/metrics` (on the same port). Metrics are compatible with prometheus.

**Note:** All metric names include the `gmf_` prefix (grafana matrix forwarder) to make sure they are unique and make them easier to find.

Exposed metrics:
  * `up` - Returns 1 if the service is up
  * Forward counts
    * `total` - total number of alerts forwarded
    * `success` - number of alerts successfully forwarded
    * `error` - number of alerts where the forwarding process failed (check logs for error details)
  * Alert counts by state
    * `total` - total number of alerts received
    * `alerting` - alert count in the *alerting* state
    * `no_data` - alert count in the *no_data* state
    * `ok` - alert count in the *ok* state (resolved alerts)
    * `other` - number of received alerts that have an unknown state (check logs for details)

**Sample**

```
# HELP gmf_up
# TYPE gmf_up gauge
gmf_up 1
# HELP gmf_forwards
# TYPE gmf_forwards gauge
gmf_forwards{result="error"} 1
gmf_forwards{result="success"} 5
gmf_forwards{result="total"} 6
# HELP gmf_alerts
# TYPE gmf_alerts gauge
gmf_alerts{state="alerting"} 1
gmf_alerts{state="no_data"} 1
gmf_alerts{state="ok"} 2
gmf_alerts{state="other"} 1
gmf_alerts{state="total"} 6
```
